# Gaussian diffusion model

## Instruction

In this project, we will use the Gaussian plume diffusion model, which represents the concentration distribution downwind of the point source as a Gaussian distribution. This code enables the visualization of the parameters of the Gaussian diffusion model and the concentration diffusion.
